                        After receiving helpful feedback on our initial design, we proceeded to create a monochrome wireframe 
                        prototype that was complete enough to "run” a new user through a particular use scenario of our system.
                         Using Balsamiq we demonstrated the overall interaction flow of our app. We particularly focused on illustrating the risky interations of our system,
                          and created the screens necessary for a user to go through the 
                         all of the main scenarios of the app.

                        <strong style="font-weight:600">Home page:</strong>
                        based on the feedback we received from our in class presentation, we decided to add a 
                        widget on the home page that highlights recurring events (such as practice times and
                         eboard/team dinners) and most upcoming social event for Wushu, with the option to add 
                         it to your calendar. This would encourage increased in person socialization within wushu
                          since the information is centralized and easy to find, while also encouraging sustained 
                          interaction and engagement with the app because users would be checking it to see what
                           the next event is. <br><br><br>

                         <strong style="font-weight:600">Choreo videos page</strong>
                         to reduce clutter on the video page, we decided to remove the ability to add text
                          comments to people’s choreo videos and instead provide the option to give 
                          personalized reactions with the content (similar to Slack, where you can react 
                          to messages with different kinds of emojis). We also decided to stick with the 
                          gallery view (like an Instagram profile) instead of the carousel to view the videos, 
                          as a gallery view is more intuitive and easier to navigate quickly.<br><br><br>

                         <strong style="font-weight:600">Photo scavenger hunt page (later changed to the Showcase feature):</strong>
                         as we did with the choreo videos page, we will remove the commenting on individual’s 
                         responses to the weekly prompt, but will add the option for personalized reactions. 
                         The scavenger hunt page will display the pictures in endless scroll format (like an
                          Instagram feed) for ease of use and to encourage interaction with the photos.<br><br><br>

                        <strong style="font-weight:600">Lunch buddy:</strong>
                        the most amount of adjustments will be made to the lunch buddy page. Users will now be 
                        presented with a list of suggested times to meet. Based on this addition, we have decided 
                        to remove the lunch announcement page since we are presuming that lunches will either 
                        be scheduled outside of the app or users will utilize the ability to select a time and 
                        “add it to Google calendar.” Additionally, we will require users to opt into the lunch 
                        buddy program every weekend, where they will be required to put their tentative availability 
                        for the week and preferred location. <br><br><br>

                        Once we had the wireframe, we conducted six sessions of usability testing with Wushu members. 
                        The purpose of this testing was to find usability problems to fix during the next design iteration.

                        All users were able to make the connection between the icons and their functionality, most likely 
                        due to the combination of the icons and accompanying text on the homepage. Users also mentioned
                         that the fork and spoon immediately signalled to them that it had something to do with eating, indicating
                          that the icons alone provided a strong signal for their purpose. <br><br>

                        Users were also able to use the icons on the homepage and the icons in the bottom navigation
                         bar with comparable ease and frequency. <br><br>

                         Lunch buddy sign up process worked quite seamlessly. All people seemed very familiar with the
                          functionality of the multiple choice questions and availability scheduler. Once lunch buddies were selected, 
                          we saw users use both the calendar option to send the lunch invite and the text message feature to 
                          schedule a hypothetical lunch date with their buddy. All users correctly assumed that selecting the calendar
                           invite would put the lunch buddy event on both their and their buddy’s calendars. None of our study participants
                            made any significant errors when going through this feature.

                        The majority of our errors were focused around the choreo videos feature. 
                        Although the majority of users indicated that they found this the most useful feature, 
                        there was a lot of confusion between the “upload” video button that weapons leaders would use 
                        to upload a choreo video for the whole team and the “share your attempt” button that general members
                         would use to share their progress on their choreo with the whole team.<br><br>

                         Another possible problematic part of our application is that several users noted that
                          they did not find the photo scavenger hunt feature as compelling as the other ones.
                           User 3 suggested that we could make the photo prompts more themed to Wushu to encourage
                            interaction and increase relevance to the Wushu team.<br><br>

                        Overall, the users did not encounter any errors with lunch buddy signup and scheduling.

                        To make the photo scavenger hunt more appealing, we decided to change the photo scavenger hunt 
                        feature from a photo scavenger hunt to something more related to Wushu to increase relevance to the
                         team and chances of interaction. This new feature will be called <strong style="font-weight:600">“showcase”</strong> 
                         and will involve a prompt asking users to take a video or picture of themselves performing a wushu move (such as a 
                         slap kick, hammer fist, etc.) and share it with their peers. <br><br>

                         In response to the risky interaction between differentiating between the upload choreo button for
                          weapons group leaders and the “share your attempt” button for general members, we have decided
                           to <strong style="font-weight:600">remove the share your attempt feature</strong> from the choreo videos page and incorporate choreo
                            sharing into the redesigned “showcase” feature. This way, users will be able to utilize the
                             most useful part of the choreo feature (viewing videos) without the additional confusion of 
                             not knowing where to share their own choreo videos. Instead, this social interaction will be placed
                              in the “showcase” feature.<br><br>  
                        
                        We also noticed that the prototype does not clearly indicate that a user has posted a new choreo 
                        video in the feed. To mitigate confusion caused by this we will have a sample post filled out 
                        and create a new screen that shows that sample post added to the feed of videos.<br><br>

                        During our user interviews, some users mentioned they could benefit from a separation between
                         the interactive buttons in the app and the Wushu events calendar on the home page. To fix this,
                          we will add a visual separator between the two groups of features, such as a box or outlined 
                          area encapsulating the calendar events.
